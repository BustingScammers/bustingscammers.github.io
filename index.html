<h1>BUSTED!</h1>
<p>You're trying to invest my computer with viruses and take my money, and <b>nobody will accept that.</b></p>
<p>You are spending your entire life tricking people, and you should be ashamed of yourself.</p>
<p>So you can either grief my <i>virtual machine</i>, or be a coward and run away.</p>
